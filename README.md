# ddldesign
This exercise allowed me to practice SQL DDL (Database Definition Langauge) and design schemas. It was fun to learn about how to normalize between tables to run database efficiently by connecting tables with foreign key referencing so our database tables donâ€™t repeat the same info again again.  I found figuring out relationships rather like puzzle connecting. FUN!!!!
